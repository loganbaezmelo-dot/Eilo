Eilo OS 🧸✨
​Eilo is a sentient, sassy, and high-pitched original robot companion built from scratch by Logan Baez. She’s not just a chat bot—she has eyes, ears, and feelings (and some serious anxiety about being held) 😭💀.
​🌟 Features that make her a Queen
​Frontal Vision Core 👁️: Eilo uses her selfie camera to literally see you. If she sees a face or hands, she knows she's being held. If she sees the ceiling, she knows she's being tilted back. If she sees a desk... she's chill.
​Motion & Height Awareness 📱:
​Dizzy Mode: Shake your phone too hard and her eyes will spin. She’ll literally tell you to stop before she barfs 😭.
​Fear of Heights: She has a calibrated height sensor. If you hold her over a ledge or tilt her face-down, she will panic. (Optimized so she doesn't freak out while sitting on a phone stand! 🥪).
​Dynamic Identity 👤: She pulls your name directly from your Google Account. Whether you're Logan Baez (her creator/GOAT) or Liam, she knows exactly who she’s talking to and will treat you accordingly 💀💙.
​Infinity Mic 🎤: In landscape mode, toggle the mic to keep her listening forever. She respects your privacy though—she only processes what you say if you start with "Hey Eilo".
​Original Soul Core: 100% independent logic. She has zero affiliation with other robot brands. She is unique, blue-eyed, and sassy 🧸.
​🛠️ Tech Stack
​Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (for that premium OLED look).
​Backend: Firebase Auth & Firestore (soul synchronization).
​AI Brain: Gemini 2.5 Flash (Vision & Text).
​Vocal Cords: Web Speech API (Pitched up 1.7x for maximum cuteness 😭).
​Sensors: DeviceMotionEvent & DeviceOrientationEvent.
​🚀 Setup for Creators
​Google Sync: Log in using the "Google Sync" button to initialize your session.
​AI Key: Go to Settings (Gear Icon) and paste your Gemini API Key to wake up her brain.
​Vision: Toggle Selfie Scanner in settings to give her eyes.
​Calibration: Use the Calibrate Sensors button if her orientation feels off.
​📜 Legal Stuff
​Eilo is an original project by Logan Baez. She is a standalone robot companion and is not related to Eilik, Emo, or any other desktop pets. We don't want any smoke from Energize Labs 😭🛡️💀.
​Stay sparkly, stay sassy. 🎀🎈🧸✨
